# Dependencies for building and installation.
#
# As with many of the other settings in this file, dependency
# information is organized by package version.  Spock will scan the
# YAML objects in this list and use the *last* group of settings
# that match the version being installed.  At least one group
# must match.
#
# The "install" property is a list of packages upon which this package
# depends when it is used in a build environment. If there's only one
# dependency it can appear as a scalar instead of a list.
#
# The "build" property lists additional packages (in addition to the
# "install" packages) that must be used when building this package.
#
# The "aliases" property lists secondary names for the installed
# package. Secondary names are used to prevent two related packages
# from being used at the same time. For instance, since gnu-c++03, 
# gnu-c++11, and llvm-c++14 are all C++ compilers, they have a
# "c++-compiler" alias which prevents more than one C++ compiler from
# being used at a time.
#
# Hint: some build systems (cmake in particular) look also for a C
# compiler whenever a C++ compiler is selected. To prevent problems,
# the build dependencies should always include "c-compiler" if they
# include any C++ compiler.

dependencies:
  - version: ">=1.50"
    aliases: []

    # "c++-compiler" means any C++ compiler from any vendor. This
    # could be a compiler that supports C++11 or a compiler (GCC or
    # LLVM) that supports the gnu++03 language, etc.
    install: [ c++-compiler, zlib ]

    # Standard C compilers (c89 c94 c11 etc) do not work: they fail to
    # compile during boost's bootstrap.sh phase. "gnu-default-c" is
    # the GCC C compiler with default language; "llvm-default-c" is
    # the LLVM C compiler with default language; and "default-c" is
    # the default C language from any vendor.
    build:   default-c

# When running shell commands, it is often useful to have variables
# whoe value depends on the version being installed.  Spock will scan
# this list to find those items that match the version, and then
# create a shell variable with the specified value.  The list is
# scanned from beginning to end, but only the last occurrence of each
# variable is used.

# Instructions for how to obtain the package.  Spock will use
# the last section which matches the version beging installed.
# This allows you to easily order your scripts using ">=VERSION"
# in ascending order.
#
# In general, whenever you see a "shell" property it is Bash shell
# commands. The commands are inserted into a shell script before being
# run, so (unlike make) side effects persist from command to command
# without needing to add semicolons and escaped linefeeds.
#
# The following variables are defined during a download:
#    PACKAGE_NAME    - the name of the package, such as "boost"
#    PACKAGE_NAME_UC - uppercase suitable as shell variable name
#    PACKAGE_VERSION - version number being processed, "1.52.0"
#    PACKAGE_HASH    - unique 8-character hash
#    PACKAGE_SPEC    - as in "boost=1.52.0@84c2d792
#    PACKAGE_ACTION  - set to "download"
#
# Plus additional variables from the
# $SPOCK_SCRIPTS/installation-support.sh file.
#
# A "set -x" is issued before the following commands run.
#
# Spock expects that the script produces a file named
# "download.tar.gz" in the CWD (which is a temporary directory).  By
# convention, these tarballs untar to a directory named "download".

download:
  - version: ">=1.50"
    shell: |
        version_underscore=$(echo "$PACKAGE_VERSION" |sed 's/\./_/g')
        wget -O - http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/$PACKAGE_VERSION/boost_$version_underscore.tar.bz2/download |\

# Instructions for building and installing a package. By "install" we
# mean that the final entities (libraries, headers, executables, man
# pages, etc) are moved into an installation directory and a YAML
# fragment is created to describe the parts.
#
# Installation from source usually consists of these parts:
#
#   1. Download a tarball (handled above)
#   2. Untar the tarball into a working directory (handled by Spock)
#   3. Configure the packages build system
#   4. Build the package in parallel
#   5. Install the package
#   6. Generate information about the package
#
# Besides the variables listed under "download" above, these variables
# are defined:
#   PACKAGE_ROOT     - the directory into which to install
#   PACKAGE_ACTION   - set to 'install'
#
# The script should define any environment variables that need to be
# adjusted when the package is actually used. It can do this with the
# "spock-export" command, which takes a variable name and a value as
# its two arguments. If the variable already exists in the user's
# environment, then it is adjusted by prepending the value specified
# by this script and separating it with colons.  For instance, by
# saying "spock-export PATH $PACKAGE_ROOT/bin" you can add the
# package's "bin" directory to the beginning of the user's PATH
# variable.

        # probably okay for two reasons: (1) the "icc" that it uses is the one matched by the dependencies.install above

        # that configuration of zlib to be used, or whether adding it only to b2 is sufficient (does bootstrap.sh need to
        # know about zlib when building b2?). Therefore, I'm adding it in both places.
